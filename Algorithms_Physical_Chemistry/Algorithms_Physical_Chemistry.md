# Physical Chemistry and Inorganic Chemistry Algorithms

## Stoichiometry (Key: If unsure, work with amount)

### Finding empirical formula of CxHyO¬≠z¬≠ from combustion data

- Find mass of C from CO2
- Find mass of H from H2O
- Find mass of O by taking total mass minus mass of (C + H)
- Do normal empirical formula calculations



### Answering volumetric analysis questions

- Figure out if amount or concentration changes and scale accordingly
- Take note of mole ratios
- For dilution, use c1V1 = c2V2
- Note for future chapters with aqueous systems: When different aqueous reagents are added, their individual concentration changes before the reaction even begins. It is thus important to take note of the **new** initial concentration before proceeding with the reaction. Typical cases include:
    - 10cm3 of HCl(aq) was added to 30cm3 of NaOH(aq)
    - Equal volumes of reagents A(aq) and B(aq) were added (both concentrations are halved)



### Answering questions involving the study of gases (eudiometry)

- Balance the equation algebraically (especially for compounds with O in them)
- Ensure that all species are gases
- Take note of the ‚Äòbefore‚Äô and ‚Äòafter‚Äô of the volume change
    - Change in temperature (removal of H2O)
    - Addition to alkaline (removal of acidic gases - E.g. CO2 and SO2)
    - Change in volume after reaction (use the species present after ‚Äì species present before; convert O2 excess into O2 unreacted and reacted first (this makes cancellation easier))



### Balancing redox half-equations (watch out for the reaction medium)

- Balance unique elements (e.g. Mn)
- Balance O by adding H2O
- Balance H by adding H+
- Balance charge by adding electrons
- For alkaline conditions, remove H+ by adding OH- to both sides of the equation (remove excess H2O terms
- To complete the full equation, ensure that the number of electrons on both halves of the equations are the same (by multiplying both half equations by a factor). The number of electrons will be important in calculations in _Electrochemistry I_.



### Determining unknown oxidation number

- Write out the ‚Äòknown equation‚Äô
- Calculate the nA : nB¬≠
- From the known equation, show nA : ne
- Connect nA : ne : nB¬≠ and see total number of electrons transferred
- Calculate the number of electrons each B gained/lost
- Hence, determine the change in oxidation state
- Variation: Both A and B are unknown, but they combine into one simple compound. Just look at their mole ratio and see how many electrons were transferred (e.g. nA : nB = 1 : 2, each A transferred twice the number of electrons as B)



## Atomic Structure (Key: look out for electronic configurations)

### Counting number of unpaired electrons

- Write out the electronic configuration
- Draw the box diagrams
- Fill in the electrons using the different rules (take note of exceptions like Cu and Co)



### Drawing graphs of successive IE

- Write out the electronic configuration
- Remove from the outermost shell (increase it gradually)
- When removing from another subshell (p ü°™ s), add a small jump
- When removing from inner shell, add a big jump



### Answering questions regarding successive IE (table or graph)

- Look at the biggest jump ‚Äì that electron is removed from the inner shell (use that to determine the number of valence electrons)
- Use the group number to answer the rest of the question
- Variations:
    - Elements do not have big jumps ‚Äì look out for removal from another subshell instead
    - Elements are arranged in order ‚Äì finding out one group number will allow you to deduce the rest



### Answering graphs of successive IE

- Look out for the IE number. If it is the second IE, you will have to add one electron back to the electronic configuration
- Look for the biggest drop ‚Äì that is the last electron of the inner shell (ns2np6)
- Count backwards to determine the electronic configuration of other elements
- Variation: You are required to deduce the value of n (i.e. you need to find out what which period the element belongs to)
    - The number of points in your graph might have too many electrons that it exceeds the limit given (e.g. A to E are elements with proton number < 20)
    - The number of points in your graph might have too many electrons that it cannot be a period 2 element



### Explaining trends of successive IE

- Overall trend increase ‚Äì removal of electrons from increasingly positive charge
- Explain small jumps and big jumps



### Explaining trend in IE across the period

- Use nuclear charge, shielding effect and effective nuclear charge to describe general trends
- Describe the two exceptions (p1 and p4)



### Explaining trend in IE down the group

- Use nuclear charge, shielding effect and effective nuclear charge to describe general trends
- Use number of electron shells as the deciding factor



## Chemical Bonding (Key: always look out for the structures)

### Drawing Lewis structures

- Arrange the odd atom in the middle
- Arrange other atoms around it
- Take care of the charges ‚Äì add electrons to the most electronegative atoms and remove electrons from the least electronegative atom. Spread the charges out
- Ensure that all peripheral atoms are satisfied (with the octet configuration)
- Look at the number of valence electrons of the central atom and count the number of lone pairs/ lone electron
- Count the total number of valence electrons of the central atom (including bond pairs). If it is greater than the octet configuration‚Ä¶
    - Period 3 and above ü°™ can expand octet ü°™ just leave it
    - Period 2 ü°™ cannot expand octet ü°™ change the double bond to a dative bond (take note of the direction of the arrow)
- Variations:
    - Odd number of electrons (e.g. NO¬≠2, NO)
    - Less than 6 valence electrons (e.g. AlCl3, BCl¬≠3)
    - More than 1 central atom ‚Äì the rules still applies; you can try different permutations and the number of bonds must make sense. There are some shapes that are useful:
      - Hexagon (6 atoms in a ring)
      - ‚ÄòTrigonal planar‚Äô - like
      - ‚ÄòAl2Cl6¬≠‚Äô - like



### Determining polarity of a molecule

- Check if there are polar bonds
- Add up the vectors of the polar bonds
- If the net dipole is non-zero, it is polar
- Tip: For molecules such as CHCl4 with a tetrahedral configuration, as long as one of the atoms connected to the central C is different and it contains polar bonds, it is polar. In fact, most organic molecules with a heteroatom is polar.



### Explaining BP/MP questions

- Look at the structure (giant ionic, giant covalent, giant metallic or simple molecular)
    - Take note of things like AlCl3, AlBr3, Si, SiO2 etc)
- Compare their bonding depending on the scenario
    - Giant vs simple ‚Äì just mention that the giant‚Äôs bond is stronger than the intermolecular forces of attraction in the simple molecular structure (e.g. ionic bond is stronger than IMF)
    - Within the structure ‚Äì use the relevant factors to compare
      - Giant metallic ‚Äì charge density and number of valence electrons
      - Giant ionic ‚Äì use the lattice energy equation (DO NOT use charge density)
      - Giant covalent
        - Bond order (greater bond order = stronger)
        - Effectiveness of overlap (larger orbital = move diffused = less effective overlap)
        - Bond polarity/ionic character (greater = stronger)
        - s-character (greater s-character = stronger/shorter bond)
      - Simple molecular
        - Look at whether the compounds exhibit id-id (non-polar and polar), pd-pd (polar) or H-bonding [(FON)-H]
        - If the structures are different
          - If the trend is correct (i.e. H-bond > pd-pd > id-id), just explain the trend from theory.
          - If the trend is not correct, the one with the higher boiling point must have more electrons. Use id-id interactions to explain instead.
        - If the structures are similar
          - For id-id, compare:
            - Surface area of contact
            - Number of electrons
          - For pd-pd, compare the net dipole.
          - For H-bonding, compare the average number of H-bonds (1 lp + 1 (FON)-H = 1 H-bond) ‚Äî the more the merrier [This factor has priority].
          - Consider the polarity of the bond (FON vs H).
      - Between giants ‚Äì this is usually accompanied by data. Look at the data and draw your conclusion (ionic bond > covalent bond and covalent bond > ionic bond are both possible)



### Explaining solubility

- Discuss about the ability to form favourable interactions. Depending on the marks, you might be required to write down ‚Äúthe energy released from forming the bonds between‚Ä¶ can compensate for the energy required to break the bonds between‚Ä¶‚Äù
- There are two cases:
    - ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù ‚Äì NH3 vs H2O. It is clear that both have H-bonding
    - ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù
      - Ethanol and water ‚Äì H-bonding of ‚ÄìOH groups
      - Ethanol and hexane ‚Äì id-id interactions of non-polar chain of ethanol with hexane



### Explaining covalent character

- Polarising power of the cation ü°™ depends on the charge density of the cation
- Polarisability of the anion ü°™ depends on the size of the anion electron cloud



  
### Explaining deviation from Lattice Energy

- Use covalent character explanation ü°™ greater covalent character = greater deviation



## Gaseous State (Key: Understand how constants and proportionality works, along with understanding the system that the experiment is conducted in)

### Understanding gaseous systems

- Vessel ‚Äì has a fixed volume 
- Two vessels with a stopcock inbetween them ‚Äì take note of whether both of them have gases, or one of them is a vacuum
- Syringe (Pinternal  = Pexternal)
    - Free-moving ‚Äì pressure is a constant at atmospheric pressure (1 atm)
    - Pressure applied ‚Äì Can change V by applying a pressure



### Constants and proportionality

- Using the pV = nRT equation, label group the constants and present it in the form of x ‚àù y (e.g. p ‚àù T or p ‚àù 1/V) 
    - Convert it into two forms (e.g. p ‚àù T)
      - p = kT
      - p1/T1 = p2/T2
- Applications
    - Graph plotting (use p = kT like y = kx)
      - Take note of temperature (it can be in oC or K; the graphs are different)
    - Comparing new pressure when temperature is changed (use p1/T1 = p2/T2 to solve)
      - For questions involving two vessels with a stopcock (both of which contains gases), calculate the new pressure for each of the gas and add them together (call the one in one vessel gas A and the other gas B)
      - There are variations where you change 2 variables instead of 1. You can use equations such as p1V1/T1 = p2V2/T2 for calculation
    - There are many variations to the two applications which use the same method)



### Ideal gas vs Real gas questions

- Ideal gas assumptions: negligible IMF, volume of gas **particles** < volume of container
- Explain conditions for ideal gas
    - Link to violation of ideal gas assumptions
      - Temperature ‚Äì IMF assumption
      - Pressure ‚Äì Both IMF and volume assumptions
- Explaining the real gas graph
    - Negative deviation ‚Äì attractive forces not-negligible
    - Positive deviation ‚Äì repulsive forces dominate



### Understanding partial pressures

- pV = nRT can be used in two ways
    - pAV = n¬≠ART ‚Äì discussion about the partial pressure of one gas
    - pV = nRT ‚Äì discussion about the total pressure of the gas
    - Note: V and T are similar in both equations because all gases in the vessel are subjected to the same volume and temperature
- Use the mole fraction and total pressure to help you with your calculations
- Use the relationship of p ‚àù n to help you in your calculations (e.g. when n x 2, p x 2)



## Energetics I ‚Äì Enthalpy (Key: Take note of the enthalpy equations and state symbols (especially for bond energies, which only works with gases))

### Calorimetry calculations

- Use the equation q = mcŒîT to calculate heat loss or heat gained by the solution
    - m = mass of the solution (use the density and volume to compute)
    - Add up masses of solutions added [e.g. 10cm3 of HCl(aq) was added to 30cm3 of NaOH(aq)]
    - Ignore the mass of solids added
- Use the equation ŒîH = -q/n to calculate the enthalpy change
    - To determine the value of n, we have to look at the definition (and the type of reaction) to determine the ‚Äúone mole‚Äù of substance that we want to study. It might not always be the limiting reagent. If it is a ŒîHr equation, just take the entire reaction as ‚Äúone mole‚Äù and compare the stoichiometric ratios of its species (e.g. 2A + B ü°™ 3C; the ratio of **equation** : A : B : C = **1** : 2 : 1 : 3).
    - The q in this reaction is different from the q in the q = mcŒîT. They are only similar assuming 100% of the heat is transferred. To check your answers, you if heat is lost to the surroundings, the magnitude of q in q = mcŒîT will definitely be smaller than the q in ŒîH = -q/n
    - Also, take note of the phrases used ‚Äì heat evolved and heat absorbed gives a positive number (the word evolved and absorbed have already taken into account the sign). Therefore, it is always easier to use heat change and include the sign, which makes you less prone to making careless mistakes.
- Variations:
    - Calorimeter‚Äôs heat capacity is also included (q = CŒîT term has to be added; the ŒîT is a similar ŒîT)
    - Extrapolation method with a graph. Extrapolate the heat gained/lost portion of the graph and find the ŒîT at the time where the reaction was started to get the actual ŒîT that takes into account the heat gained/lost to the surroundings



### Drawing energy cycles

- Write down all relevant equations
- Connect terms that are unique
- Balance the equations (you can examine equations one by one to make sure that the left- and right-hand side are balanced)
- Add in the ŒîH values with the correct coefficient (based on the equations)
- Apply Hess‚Äô law
- Tips:
    - Whatever you do not use, you can simply copy it down
    - Adding a reagent to the arrow or the reactant side is the same
    - If unsure about drawing multiple arrows from reagents to products, it is a good practice to split them into parts
    - If you are stuck, try starting from another point



### Drawing Born-Haber cycles

- Born-Haber cycles are used for ionic compounds
- Use FAIEL
    - Formation
    - Atomisation
    - Ionisation energy
    - Electron affinity
    - Lattice energy
- Apply Hess‚Äô Law
- Points to note:
    - Using the equations derived from the definitions to determine the correct coefficients (e.g. 2Al(g) ü°™ 2Al3+(g) + 6e is 2(1st IE + 2nd IE + 3rd IE) 
    - Ionisation energy has to come before electron affinity (electrons have to be produced before they are consumed)
    - You are only allowed to combine similar terms on the same species (e,g. 1st IE + 2nd IE; 1st EA + 2nd EA (take note of overall sign; might be endo or exo); bond energy). You are not allowed to do ŒîHatomization(Na + Cl) 
    - Remember the arbitrary zero (it is at the ground state of the elements) and the axis
    - Remember that the arrows have to come into contact with the various levels; the magnitude of the arrows should look correct (i.e. -400 shouldn‚Äôt be longer than -800); the arrows should be pointing in the correct direction (i.e. -400 should not be pointing upwards)



### Answering questions involving energy level diagrams

- Draw an energy cycle
- Convert it into the energy cycle, taking into account the magnitudes and directions of the arrow
- Just start drawing from any point. If you are stuck, try another point
- Apply Hess‚Äô law
- Variations:
    - Using energy level diagrams to explain stability
      - Identify if the products/reactants are the same. They are on the same energy level
      - Complete the energy level diagram and you will be able to see the relative levels of the different species. The one at a lower level is the more stable species.



### Solving dissolution questions involving ionic compounds

- Explaining ŒîHsolubility
    - ¬≠Use the equation ŒîHsolubility  = ‚àëŒîHhydration \+ Lattice energy
    - If you forget, just redraw the energy cycle to determine the equation.
    - Take note of coefficients, especially for ŒîHhydration
- Calculating a two cycle ŒîHsolubility ¬≠question
    - Draw the two cycles with the two ionic compounds (the two compounds will either have the same cation or anion, which will be the key in solving for the unknown value)
    - Use the two cycles to solve for the unknown value



## Energetics II ‚Äì Entropy and Gibb‚Äôs Free Energy (Key: Take note of signs)

### Determining factors affecting ŒîS

- If number of moles of gases in the equation changes, use that as the main explanation
    - Unless it is countertrend. In that case, we will use any explanation that makes sense
- If there is a change in state, use that as the main explanation over increase in number of particles (in solid or liquid state)
    - Unless it is countertrend. In that case, we will use any explanation that makes sense
- If there is mixing, talk about increase in disorder
- If there is change in temperature, use the Boltzmann distribution curve to explain the increase in the number of ways to arrange particles due to the broadening of the Boltzmann distribution curve



### Calculations involving ŒîG = ŒîH ‚Äì TŒîS

- Take note of the sign of ŒîH and ŒîS
- Take note of the units of ŒîS (it‚Äôs usually in Jmol-1K-1 while the rest are kJmol-1)
- Watch out for the units Jmol-1K-1 and JK-1 is different (Jmol-1K-1 refers to per mole of reaction while JK-1 takes into account the amount of substance present) ‚Äì this is similar to the ŒîH and q
- Variations:
    - Phase/state change (i.e. boilng, melting, sublimation etc) ü°™ ŒîG = 0
    - Question asks for the reverse process (ŒîSmelting = -ŒîSfreezing). This similar concept applies to ŒîG and ŒîH



## Kinetics (Key: Check for pseudo-order reactions)

### Drawing the two types of graphs

- Concentration-time graphs
    - rate = gradient
    - zero-order = Diagonal line
    - First-order = curve with constant half-life
- Rate-concentrationx graphs
    - Write out the rate equation
    - use y = kxn graphs
    - Variations
      - rate = k[A][B], plot rate against [A][B]. This is a y = kx graph
      - rate = k[A]2, plot rate against [A]2. This is a y = kx graph



### Determining pseudo-order reactions

- Write down the rate equation
- **Within** the experiment, one of the reagent‚Äôs concentration might stay the same throughout the experiment
    - If it is a catalyst
    - If it is in large excess (around 10x more)
    - If it is a solvent (similar to large excess)
- Write down the pseudo-order rate equation and express k‚Äô. Take note that the pseudo-order reaction only applies **within** the experiment. We can change everything‚Äôs concentration between two reactions.
- Example:
    - Rate = k[A]a[B]b, [B] >> [A]
    - Rate = k‚Äô[A]a, where k‚Äô = k[B]b



### Answering initial rate questions

- This usually appears in the form of a table (conc and rate data are given)
- Use either the inspection method or the algebraic method to solve for the orders of reaction (the algebraic method can be used for tougher examples)
- Variation: Half-life comparison. (Refer to later portion on answering half-life questions)



### Answering clock reaction questions

- This usually appears in the form of a table (volume and time is given instead; contrast this to initial rate questions)
- Understand the role of each reagent. Not everything is in the rate equation
- Check that total volume is constant (Volume of reagent used ‚àù concentration) ‚Äì This is why there is a column of DI water
- Identify the ‚Äúfuse‚Äù for the reaction (when would I stop the stopwatch)
    - Iodine clock ‚Äì when thiosulfate is fully consumed
    - Sulfur clock ‚Äì when enough sulfur covers the cross/image
    - Decolourisation of a reactant (this is a little more tedious)*
- Check that the [‚Äòfuse‚Äô] is a constant. Only then will rate ‚àù 1/time
- Use the inspection method/algebraic method to solve for the order of reactions
- For decolourisation of a reactant, the [‚Äòfuse‚Äô] might not be constant. Since average rate = -[reactant]/time taken, when the [reactant] x 2, the time taken should x2 given the same rate. However, if the reaction is first-order with respect to the reactant, when [reactant] x 2, rate also x 2. Hence, the time required will remain the same.



### Answering concentration-time graph questions

- Reactant-time graph
    - Determine the pseudo-order rate equation
    - Look at the species on the y-axis and look at the graph to determine the order of reaction
    - Use the initial rate method (inspection or algebraic) to solve for the order of the reagent in huge excess by comparing gradient at t = 0 for the two graphs.
      - For first-order reaction, you might be asked to use the half-life method. t1/2 = ln2/k‚Äô for a pseudo-first order reaction, which can be rewritten into ln2/k[B]x, where B is the reagent in large excess. Observe how half-life changes with a change in [B] (inspection or algebraically).
- Product-time graph
    - Zero-order graphs are relatively straightforward; for first-order graphs, determine the terminal concentration (from stoichiometric calculations; assuming 100% reaction) and look at 0% ü°™ 50% and 50% ü°™ 75% mark and compare their half-lives. They should have similar half-lives.
    - To compare between two graphs, we can use the same initial rate method where we find the gradient at t=0. Mathematically it will work out.
- Variations:
    - Volume of titrant-time graph ‚Äì you can calculate the concentration of your reactant and product from the volume of the titrant
    - Absorbance (or other weird metrics)-time graph ‚Äì Just read the question and they will tell you that the weird metric is an estimate of concentration
    - Non-pseudo-order reactions ‚Äì The shape of the graph represents the overall order of reaction. (e.g. rate = k[A][B]. If neither A or B is in large excess, overall order is second-order (1 + 1 = 2). The graph should be a second order graph)
    - When you are not given the 50% and 75% for [product]-time graph or 50% and 25% for [reactant]-time graph
      - For [reactant]-time graphs, you can choose random starting points and halve their concentrations. The half-life should be the same if it is a first-order reaction
      - For [product]-time graphs, you will need to convert it back to the [reactant]-time graph first.
        - E.g. [product] + [reactant] = 1;
        - When [product] = 0.2, [reactant] = 0.8
        - When [product] = 0.6, [reactant] = 0.4
        - Therefore, we can use 0.2 and 0.6 of the [product]-time graph for calculation



### Answering half-life questions

- This only applies to reactions who are first-order/pseudo first-order (do your pseudo-order analysis first)
- For a first-order reaction, the time taken for the concentration to decrease by a certain proportion (e.g. half) is the same regardless of the initial conc (time taken to turn 1 ü°™ 0.5 ü°™ 0.25 is the same, i.e. half-life is constant)
- If it is a pseudo-first order reaction, look at whether the concentration of the reactant (which is in large excess or is a catalyst) changes. If it changes, it might affect half-life (if it is not zero order)
- Apply the equation [A] = (0.5)n[A]0, where n is the number of half-lives and [A]0 is the initial concentration



### Autocatalysis graphs

- The product of the reaction catalyses the reaction (hence the rate speeds up)
- Nearer the end, the rate slows down because concentrations of all reactants are low, hence rate decreases
- Can be applied to both rate-conc (use the rate equation) and conc-time graphs (rate = gradient)



### Enzymatic rate-conc graphs

- It starts off with first order, then tapers off to zero order because the sites are saturated
- Some other reactions have the same profiles ‚Äì just use the same exact explanation



### Determining correct mechanisms

- These two rules must be satisfied
    - The rate equation must match the slow step
    - The sum of all the steps should give you the overall equation (cancel off all intermediates)
- Variations: 
    - The slow step is not the first step
      - Write the rate equation using the slow step
      - Replace the intermediates with reactants from earlier steps
      - Example:



A + 2B ü°™ C (fast)

C + D ü°™ E (slow)

Since C is produced and consumed (i.e. it is an intermediate), we replace it with the reactants required to produce


Rate = k[C][D] ü°™ rate = k[A][B]2[D]

- Question might ask you to suggest a mechanism. Read the question carefully for clues. Apply standard mechanism rules.



## Equilibrium [Key: Write out the equilibrium expression, taking into account heterogenous and homogenous equilibrium (i.e. look out for state symbols)]

### Answering questions without the need for ICE table

- When there is no indication of a before-and-after reaction and establishing of new equation
- Simply write out the equilibrium expression and substitute the relevant numbers



### Answering questions involving ICE table

- Determine the units to use for the ICE table (concentration, pressure, volume, amount?)
    - Concentration/amount for aqueous solutions (take note of the new concentration after mixing)
    - Pressure/volume/amount for gaseous systems
      - Use pressure at constant volume (fixed vessel)
      - Use volume at constant pressure (free-moving syringe)
      - Use amount when all else fails, or if it is the easiest way to solve the question
- Place as many terms that you can place in the ICE table, then include algebraic terms for the rest. Look out for additional information in the question that can help you to solve for it. Examples include:
    - The total pressure is given (you will need to add all pressures at eqm; you can use mole fraction in your calculations)
    - The percentage dissociation is given (if [A]0 = x and percentage dissociation is 30%, change = -0.3x, equilibrium = 0.7x
    - 2:1 ratio of reactants are added (this might allow you to spot some patterns in the equilibrium ‚Äì common factors etc)
- Convert it back to pressure or concentration for Kp and Kc¬≠ calculations respectively
- Points to note: 
    - The mole ratio of the reactants in the equation simply tells you about the proportion during the **change** part of your ICE table. It does NOT tell you the proportion of the reactants and products currently present.
    - When a change is done to the system, it changes the new **initial** of the ICE table, not the **change** row of your ICE table. When a change is introduced to the system, Q changes (new **Initial** ). Q will then change ( **change** ) and stop when it reaches K ( **equilibrium** ). (See section on _Answering Le Chatelier‚Äôs Principle Questions_ )



### Answering Le Chatelier‚Äôs Principle Questions

- Talk about the change to the system
- Talk about the direction of shift of position of equilibrium (PoE)
- Talk about what the shift in PoE does
- Quantitatively, you can refer to Q vs K (reaction quotient vs equilibrium constant)
    - Both Q and K share the same equation (Q is at that moment (i.e. **Initial** in your ICE table), K is at equilibrium (i.e. the **Equilibrium** in your ICE table))
    - When concentration changes, Q changes and it tries to revert back to K
    - When temperature changes, K changes and Q plays catch up 
- Note: Recall that K only changes when you change temperature, or if it is a totally new experiment/in a different solvent



### Plotting equilibrium graphs

- When concentration or partial pressure changes, there will be an immediate spike in the graph (new **initial** ). On the other hand, when temperature changes, there is no spike.
- Note: LCP only reduces the change; it does not totally remove it. Therefore, if there is an immediate spike, the concentration should not return to its original level/exceed it.
- You can connect the ICE table with the plotting of equilibrium graphs
- Changing the volume will change the concentrations/partial pressures in an inversely proportional manner (i.e. when V is doubled, pressure halves. The pressures do not decrease equally (i.e. pa = 8, pb = 4. When V is doubled, new pa = 4, new pb = 2 (magnitude changes for both cases are different)



### Adding an inert gas into a mixture and determine if PoE shifts

- At constant volume, p ‚àù n ü°™ individual gases‚Äô partial pressures remain constant
- At constant pressure, V ‚àù n ü°™ Since volume changes, all gases‚Äô partial pressure changes
- Compare Q vs K
    - If number of moles on both sides of the equation is the same, PoE does not shift
    - If number of moles on both sides of the equation is not the same, PoE shifts



### Answering questions connecting ŒîG and K

- It helps to remember the equation ŒîG = -RTlnK (not in syllabus)
- When K is large, ŒîG is negative; vice-versa 



## Acid-base equilibria (Key: What is present in the solution?)

### 3 key-points on the graph

- At the start, only the weak acid/weak base is present
    - Use [H+] = or [OH-] = 
    - Find pH or pOH ü°™ pH (pH + pOH = 14)
    - Note: This equation is derived from drawing the ICE table. Do be clear about how this is derived.
- After addition of some reagent (strong acid/alkali), we get a buffer solution
    - Use the Henderson-Hasselbach equation:



![](<images/Algorithms_Physical_Chemistry_image1.png>)

- Replace pH with pOH, pKa with pKb and [A-]/[HA] with [BH+]/[B] for alkali buffers.
    - Since both [A-] and [HA] are in the same solution, you can simply work with (number of moles of A-)/(number of moles of HA)
- At equivalence point
    - There is only the conjugate acid/base present. Salt hydrolysis occurs (Example is for weak acid)
      - Find Kb using Kw/Ka
      - Use [OH-] = (Note: [conj. Base] is not the same as initial [HA]. We have added some VNaOH¬≠. You will need to calculate the [conj. Base] using the dilution formula)
      - Solve for pH 



### Polyprotic graphs

- The only difference for polyprotic graphs is their first few equivalence points (before the last one)



H2A ‚áå HA- \+ H\+  Ka1

HA- ‚áå A2- \+ H+ Ka2

HA- can act as both an acid and a base

Compare Ka2 and Kb1. If Ka2 > K¬≠b1, it acts as an acid. Choose the acid dissociation path. Vice versa

- Depending on the pH region/volume of NaOH added, different buffer systems are chosen. You need to choose the relevant K¬≠a expression which contains both the reactants and products at that pH



### Buffer questions

- Preparing buffers and calculating pH
    - Buffers can be made by mixing weak acid/its conjugate base, vice versa
      - Simply substitute the amounts into the Henderson-Hasselbach equation
    - Buffers can be made by reacting a weak acid with a strong base to form its conjugate base, vice versa
      - Find the remaining weak acid and the amount of conjugate base formed, then substitute the amounts into the Henderson-Hasselbach equation
- Changing the pH of buffers by adding H+ or OH-
    - Calculate the new amounts of conjugate base and weak acid (vice versa) and substitute the amounts into the Henderson-Hasselbach equation



## Solubility Equilibria (Key: Is this question about solubility or precipitation?)

### Dissolution

- Dissolution in water
    - Draw the ICE table and set ions to 0 (in DI water)
    - Write the Ksp expression and solve for solubility/use the concentration of ions to solve for Ksp¬≠
    - Note: Solubility is the amount of solid that can dissolve in 1 dm3. This means that if for 1 mole of PbCl2, it produces 1 mole of Pb2+ and 2 moles of Cl-¬≠. That‚Äôs the reason why we use x for Pb2+ and 2x for Cl-. What if we worked with Al2(CO3)3? Then it will be 2x for Al3+ and 3x for CO32-. Solubility will then be x
- Dissolution in solution with a common ion 
    - Draw the ICE table and set the common ion with the relevant concentration
    - Assume that x is negligible
    - Note: we can assume the ‚Äúx‚Äù to be negligible because the ionic salts are sparingly soluble



### Precipitation

- Compare IP and Ksp (If IP > Ksp, precipitation is formed)
    - Points to note: 
      - This concept is similar to Q and K. When Q changes, it will move back to K if it can.
      - There is a difference between pouring two solutions together and adding a solid into a solution for precipitation. The former requires a recalculation of the new concentration before substitution into the IP expression 
- Selective Precipitation (AgCl and AgBr as example; AgBr precipitates first)
    - Calculate the [Ag+] just as AgCl is precipitated (IP = Ksp), using [Cl-] and Ksp (AgCl) ‚Äì All Cl- is still in the equation so we can just substitute it in
    - Use the [Ag+] concentration to find [Br-] using Ksp (AgBr). Some Br- is now in the precipitate. We can use [Ag+] because it is in the same solution
    - To find the separation efficiency, we take [Br-]remaining/[Br-]initial
    - To find nBr- in precipitate, we can take initial amount of Br- and subtract amount of Br\- in the solution (calculate the amount using concentration and volume)
    - To find nAgNO3 used, find nAg+ in the solution and in the AgBr precipitate. Add them together
    - Note: Precipitates are formed when IP > Ksp, simply because PoE shifts to the direction to product the precipitate, decreasing IP, till IP = Ksp. Hence, when we are looking at this question, both AgCl and AgBr are at IP = Ksp



### Explaining solubility using shifts in PoE

- Write out both equations ‚Äì (1) solubility equilibria and the (2) reaction inducting the change
- See how reaction (2) changes the amount of the species that exists in (1)
- Use the idea of shifting PoE to explain the shift in the equilibrium
- Once IP < Ksp, solubility occurs. If solubility does not occur, conclude that decrease in IP is not enough to fall below Ksp



## Electrochemistry I ‚Äì Voltaic Cell (Key: Do I have all the species required?)

### Calculating Ecell

- Questions might require you to draw the cell
- Copy and paste the relevant equations from your data booklet
- The more positive/less negative species will be reduced; vice versa for the oxidation half
- Calculate Ecell by using Ecell¬≠ = Ered ‚Äì Eox
- Note: Since all reagents are present in the cell, the reaction should technically always be feasible



### Predicting feasibility of reaction

- Determine which species is oxidized/reduced
- Assume that the reaction is feasible and calculate Ecell ¬≠(copy the equations as it is and do not flip them ‚Äì the subtraction operation in Ecell¬≠ = Ered ‚Äì Eox would have taken care of it) 
- n = 2). This is different from the one in Q=It calculations)
- Cases:
    - When it is a clear-cut case (one can only be oxidised, the other can only be reduced)
    - When one can only be oxidized while the other can go either way (e.g. Fe2+)
    - When both can only be oxidized/reduced
- If Ecell¬≠ is negative, reaction is not feasible, vice versa
- In some cases, you might be asked to calculate ŒîG using the formula ŒîG = -nFE (the n here is the number of electrons transferred when you are balancing the equation (e.g. Cl2 \+ 2e ü°™ 2Cl-; 
- Note: When two aqueous solutions are added, we do not need to refer to the H2O equations because the species are soluble in water. We only use H¬≠2O equations in electrolytic cells



### Changing of Ecell ¬≠values with the shift in equilibrium

- Look at how the change affects either of the half-cells (it is important to study this separately)
- Use the idea of shifts in PoE to determine the new Ered¬≠ or E¬≠ox values. (e.g. Cl2 \+ 2e ‚áå 2Cl-; if AgNO3 is added, some Cl- is precipitated out. Hence, the PoE shifts to the right, and the Ered value becomes more positive/less negative)
- Use the equation Ecell¬≠ = Ered ‚Äì Eox to study the change.



## Electrochemistry II ‚Äì Electrolytic Cell (Key: Based on the battery, which is my anode/cathode?)

### Determining reactions occurring at the different electrodes

- Using the battery, determine the polarity of the different electrodes (+ on battery = + on electrode)
- Decide which species exist at which electrode (take note of electrode material); water automatically goes to both electrodes (look for 0.83 and 1.23 in your data booklet)
- Copy the exact equations and values from your data booklet
- For the cathode, the equation with the most positive/least negative Eo value will get reduced (read from left to right)
- For the anode, the equation with the least positive/most negative Eo value will get oxidized (read from right to left)
- Combine both equations together to form the overall equation
- Note:
    - There could be exceptions such as concentrated NaCl. In this case, Cl2 will be liberated instead of O¬≠2
    - You can calculate the Ecell ¬≠for the overall equation. It should give you a negative number. This can be useful when you combine this with a voltaic cell question. You will need at least the |Ecell, electrolytic| as your Ecell, battery ¬≠for your battery for this reaction to work.



### Anodising of Al questions

- Water is oxidized
- Al reacts with water to form Al2O3



### Purification of copper

- There are two types of impurities (one is less likely to be oxidized than Cu (e.g. Ni), one is more likely (e.g. Ag))
- The more likely one will get oxidized first and go into the solution. Cu will follow. Ag will fall off as sludge
- Both Ni2+ and Cu2+ will go to the cathode (the pure Cu). Cu2+ is more likely to be reduced. Hence, it deposits on the surface



### Q = It calculations

- Use the relationship of Q = It = neF and ne : nspecies to solve the question
- Example (find nCu given Q)



Solve for ne

From the equation, nCu : ne = 1 : 2

### Solve nCu

- Note: For the earlier question on the purification of copper, more copper will be deposited than copper lost from the impure copper. Some charge is used for oxidation of Ni. This means that the solution‚Äôs colour intensity will decrease as some Cu2+ is removed from the solution.



## Periodicity (Key: Just memorise; use your earlier knowledge on chemical bonding and atomic structure to help you out)

### Important periodic table trends (chemical properties)

- Reactions of period 3 oxides and pH
- Reactions of period 3 chlorides and pH



### Explaining acidity of period 3 metals

- Use charge density of Mg2+ and Al3+ to explain the ability to polarize the O-H bond in water
- Write down the equation (take note of the overall charge)



### Explaining thermal stability of carbonates, nitrates etc (ionic compound)

- Look at the charge density of the cation ü°™ polarizing power
- Explain how well the cation can polarize the anion electron cloud, hence the extent that the bond is weakened



### Explaining thermal stability of group 17 hydrogen halides

- Explaining using factors affecting covalent bond strength to break the bonds



### Explaining reactivity of Group 17 halogens

- Compare Eocell of the following reactions
    - Halogen + halide (can be used to distinguish all)
    - Halogen + Fe (Cl2 and Br2 VS I2) ‚Äì show the final product FeX2 vs FeX3
    - Halogen + thiosulfate (Cl2 and Br2 VS I2) ‚Äì show the final product SO42- or S2O82- and discuss about the oxidation numbers of the S atom
